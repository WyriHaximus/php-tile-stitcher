# Installation

To install via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), use the command below, it will automatically detect the latest version and bind it with `^`.

```
composer require wyrihaximus/tile-stitcher
```

# Usage

The stitcher needs two things:
* Tile dimensions, it assumes they are all the same size
* A list of tile files to stitch together

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Intervention\Image\Drivers\Gd\Driver;
use Intervention\Image\ImageManager;
use WyriHaximus\TileStitcher\Coordinate;
use WyriHaximus\TileStitcher\Dimensions;
use WyriHaximus\TileStitcher\FileLoader;
use WyriHaximus\TileStitcher\Stitcher;
use WyriHaximus\TileStitcher\Tile;

$tiles = [
    new Tile(
        new Coordinate(69, 69),
        new FileLoader('map/69_69.png'),
    ),
    new Tile(
        new Coordinate(70, 69),
        new FileLoader('map/70_69.png'),
    ),
];

$stitcher = new Stitcher(
    new ImageManager(
        new Driver(),
    ),
);

$image = $stitcher->stitch(
    'image/png',
    Map::calculate(
        new Dimensions(512, 512),
        ...$tiles,
    ),
);

file_put_contents('output/two_tile.png', $image);
```

The result:

![Two tile stitched image](tests/maps/1x2.png)

# Advanced

## Loaders

The main goal of this package is to take tiles and stitch them together into one, there for all I/O bound operations
have not place in this package. However we can't ignore the fact that we need to load tile images from somewhere. And
since some maps can be massive the `LoaderInterface` is included to do reading I/O. A `FileLoader` is included in this
package to provide the most basic implementation. (And, well, not ship a package without being fully functional ðŸ˜….)

For example this is an implementation using [`react/filesystem`](https://github.com/reactphp/filesystem/?tab=readme-ov-file#getcontents):

```php
use React\Filesystem\Node\FileInterface;

use function React\Async\await;

final readonly class ReactFileLoader implements LoaderInterface
{
    public function __construct(private FileInterface $file)
    {
    }

    public function load(): string
    {
        return await($this->file->getContents());
    }
}
```

This is an example using [`Flysystem`](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/docs/) unlocking S3 and a whole range of
different storage systems:

```php
use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;

final readonly class FLysystemFileLoader implements LoaderInterface
{
    public function __construct(private Filesystem $filesystem, private string $path)
    {
    }

    public function load(): string
    {
        return $this->filesystem->read($this->path);
    }
}
```

## Locators

Locators can be used in stead of passing a static list of tile objects to the `Map::calculate` as a way to handle more
dynamic use cases. This package ships with the `CallalbleTileLocator` to aid with average day usage of this package.
It will pass the path you give it plus the file name into the callable you pass it. The callable can either return a
`Tile` or null on no-op. And it will never go deeper than one level.

```php
$image = $stitcher->stitch(
    'image/png',
    Map::calculate(
        new Dimensions(512, 512),
        new CallalbleTileLocator(
            'map/',
            static function (string $fileName): Tile {
                $fileNameWithoutExtension = str_replace('.png', '', basename($fileName));
                $coords = explode('_', $fileNameWithoutExtension);

                return new Tile(
                    new Coordinate(
                        ...array_map('intval', $coords),
                    ),
                    new FileLoader($fileName),
                );
            }
        ),
    ),
);
```

Any implementation of the `TileLocatorInterface` is only expected to return an iterable of `Tile` instances. The `Map`
will only iterate over it once.
